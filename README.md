## What is CV-Template?

**CV-Template** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [CurVe CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-customised-curve-cv/mvmbhkwsnmwv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.
